Working on testnet, replace values with addresses for any Uniswap Fork!!

//install ethers npm i ethers

OK FRIENDS!!! How to use, where it says secrets.provider, paste the endpoint api for a JSONRPCProvider, or change the line 'ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider()' to ethers.providers.WebSocketProvider() is you prefer!

all the current addresses are put in for the BSC Testnet, paste the address of WBNB BEP-20, BUSD BEP-20, PancakeswapRouterV2.

It currently just executes a trade of 100 BUSD for however many WBNB!
